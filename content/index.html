<h1>What is this?</h1>

<p>A simple home page for me to </p>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Change this page's content</strong> by editing the "index.html" file in the "content" directory. This is the actual page content, and therefore doesn't include the header, sidebar or style information (those are part of the layout).</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>Change the layout</strong>, which is the "default.html" file in the "layouts" directory, and create something unique (and hopefully less bland).</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Test1</li>
	<li>Test2</li>
</ul>
