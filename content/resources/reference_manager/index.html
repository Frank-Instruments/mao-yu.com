<h2>Mendeley</h2>
<a href="http://www.mendeley.com/">Homepage</a>

Mendeley is my current preferred reference manager. Reasons why I like it:
<ul><li>Automatic synchronization of references</li>
	<li>Synchronization of up to 500 MB of attachments</li>
	<li>Public profiles - see mine <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/profiles/mao-yu/">here</a></li>
	<li>Shared collection - automatic sharing of collection of references</li>
	<li>Use of sqlite for database - you can write your own scripts to read the bibliographic data</li>
	<li>Automatic parsing of PDF files - not a big deal for me, since I import mostly from Google scholar anyways, but good for those old old papers</li>
	<li>Extensions for Open Office, Word</li>
</ul>

<h2>Others to look at</h2>
<h3>Zotero</h3>
<a href="http://www.zotero.org/">Homepage</a>
Another popular free reference manager built as a Firefox extension.  Since I use Opera, this is less ideal for me.

<h3>Endnote</h3>
<a href="http://www.endnote.com/">Homepage</a>
The old commercial reference manager that everybody liked before Mendeley.
