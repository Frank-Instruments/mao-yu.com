<h2>Summary</h2>
<%= @item[:summary] %>

<h3>Command line argument parsing</h3>
<div class="summary_footer">
	<ul><li><a href="http://maoserr.github.com/C-library/argparser/">Documentation</a></li>
	</ul>
</div>
This is a simple command line argument parsing routine, meant to be included
in source form in the project.  Some features are:
<ul><li>Short ('-v') and long ('--verbose') argument parsing</li>
	<li>Argument parsing with values ('-v 1' would set argument with name 'v' to '1')</li>
	<li>Ability to detect unknown arguments</li>
	<li>Ability to parse both command line ('argc' and 'argv') and also a config file</li>
</ul>
To see a short example, take a look at the documentation.

<h3>Logging interface</h3>
<div class="summary_footer">
	<ul><li><a href="http://maoserr.github.com/C-library/logger/">Documentation</a></li>
	</ul>
</div>
This is a simple logging interface, meant to be included in source form in
the project. Some features are:
<ul><li>Handles logging to file, console, and custom callback</li>
	<li>Ability to log with different levels (from 0 and up), and set a cut off
	based on level</li>
</ul>
To see a short example, take a look at the documentation.
