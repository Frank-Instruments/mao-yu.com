<h2>About</h2>
<p>RedshiftGUI is a fork of the <a href="http://jonls.dk/redshift/">Redshift project</a> by Jon Lund Steffensen. It was something I made because I wanted a GUI version of the program. The Redshift project itself is inspired by <a href="http://jonls.dk/redshift/">f.lux</a>, and there's more information on the benefit of this program on their home page.</p>
